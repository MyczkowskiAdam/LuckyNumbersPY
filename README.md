# Lucky Name Numbers

Many ancient philosophers believed that everything in the universe is made up of and
affected by numbers. Different societies developed different methods of analysis to
calculate if individual pieces of information such as name and birthdate could be used to
predict how lucky someone would be in life.

One of the greatest mathematicians, Pythagoras developed a method that could be applied
to anyone’s name to calculate their lucky name number.

The Pythagorean system allocated a number to each letter of the alphabet and these
numbers were used to calculate a single digit number from the letters in a person’s name:

		|=======================================|
		|	1	2	3	4	5	6	7	8	9	|
		|	a	b	c	d	e	f	g	h	i	|
		|	j	k	l	m	n	o	p	q	r	|
		|	s	t	u	v	w	x	y	z	 	|
		|=======================================|

For example, Eleanor Wiseman would be:

		|===============================================================|
		|	5	3	5	1	5	6	9		5	9	1	5	4	1	5	|
		|	E	l	e	a	n	o	r		W	i	s	e	m	a	n	|
		|===============================================================|

To carry out the calculation all the numbers for the first name are added together as are all
the numbers for the surname.

		= {5 + 3 + 5 + 1 + 5 + 6 + 9} + {5 + 9 + 1 + 5 + 4 + 1 + 5}
		= 34 + 30

These numbers are added again until the answer is a single digit.

		= 7 + 3
		= 10
		= 1

So Eleanor’s lucky name number would be 1.
